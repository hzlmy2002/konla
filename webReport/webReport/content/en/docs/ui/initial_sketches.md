We created our initial sketches by hand-drawing them, which allowed us to abstract out colours and fonts so that we could focus on key features and how to layout content.

In our first sketch, we designed the upload and analysis pages. For uploading, we wanted users to be able to drag-and-drop their PDF files as well as select them manually from local storage. On the analysis page, we had a side navigation panel where users can select between different features. At this stage in the project, we thought about the following features: About, Read, Figures, and References.

The About section contained the title, metadata, and author names. The Figures section would have shown a carousel of images
extracted from the paper which users could cycle through using the left and right arrows. Below the image, we had considered putting a short summary of the image.

Sketch 2 covers the rest of the sections. The Metrics section displayed calculations performed on the extracted text, such as the count of characters and words along with the reading/speaking times. The References section listed each reference with its index to the left. Finally, the Read section was inspired by articles on [science.org](https://www.science.org/). The abstract from a paper would be put inside its own block to stand out, and then the title of each section would be presented just above that section's content. The idea was to make reading papers consistent by having one format for the content, in contrast with the many ways research papers are presented.
