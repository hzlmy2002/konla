Our first user interface was for the prototype demo application. We needed users to be able to upload a paper and see the results sent from the backend.

On the upload page, users can upload their papers by clicking the browse link to open a file explorer dialog or simply dragging the file into the dotted area.

Once they have successfully selected a file, they are presented with a checkboxes for each analysis feature. At least one must be selected before the analysis process can begin.

For the demo, the analysis page only had two sections. We showed the raw extracted text and the keyword extraction. Keywords along with their frequency was shown in a table.
