After the initial sketches, we could then start designing some high-fidelity mockups of the application. These would now include colours and fonts to resemble the finished UI. We used a mockup design platform, [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), as not only could it let me design the interfaces, but it also had a great simulation feature where we were able to connect buttons with frames to demonstrate how users would interact with the application.
