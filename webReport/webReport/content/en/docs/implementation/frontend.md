## Frontend Structure
The frontend follows a standard Vue 3 web application structure generated by vue-cli. The current user interface folder is located in src/frontend/vue-web-app.
```
./vue-web-app/src
├─ components
│  ├─ ErrorContent.vue
│  ├─ Footer.vue
│  ├─ Header.vue
│  ├─ KeywordsContent.vue
│  ├─ LoadingIcon.vue
│  ├─ MetadataContent.vue
│  ├─ MetricsContent.vue
│  ├─ PartialContent.vue
│  ├─ RefsContent.vue
|  └─ WholeContent.vue
│
├─ router
|  └─ index.js
│
├─ views
|  ├─ Upload.vue
|  └─ Analysis.vue
│
├─ App.vue
└─ main.js
```

As in standard Vue application, in **main.js** the app is created and mounted to the “#app” div in the html template specified in index.html in vue-web-app/public directory.
The **index.js** in router maps the endpoints to the corresponding views (“/” for Upload.vue and “/analysis” for Analysis.vue). The views use templated components for displaying different parts of the webpage to create a better and more comprehensible structure. 

The user interface consists of two views:
* upload view (Upload.vue), which is the default page when the service is accessed
*	analysis view (Analysis.vue), which is visible once the research paper was uploaded and analysis features were selected

The upload view retrieves the selected features and the research paper in .pdf and pushes it as a JSON object to the Analysis View shortly after the user clicks on “Analyse Paper”. Next, the analysis view is displayed, checks the selected features and sends request to upload the paper from frontend and start selected analysis tasks. Once it receives a confirmation that analysis tasks started, it continuously sends requests for results of analysis to the backend. After it receives a particular feature, the view is dynamically updated.

## Useful Commands and Frontend Configuration
