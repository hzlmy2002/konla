Our client is [Lacibus Ltd.](https://lacibus.com/) represented by its founder Dr Chris Harding. Lacibus was formed to productize the idea of a web platform whose users work with data, and the providers of the data control access to it [1]. 

Our client asked us to develop a platform for organising website content and research data for researchers and web developers. After further discussion, we all came to the conclusion that these two user segments are too different to produce a single service for them. Therefore, we decided to focus on researchers and create software that would help them in getting insight from the research papers.
