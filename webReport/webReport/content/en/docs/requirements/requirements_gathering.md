As students at University College London (UCL), we could easily find and contact several PhD students, our tutors and other researchers to talk about their common pains and needs.

### An extract from one of the executed interviews

***From a computer science researcher who is doing research in software engineering***


***Do you have any problems when reading papers?***  

*Of course. For example, I received lots of reports and papers regarding the COVID-19. Reading a lot of them is quite a pain and what makes it worse is usually they include complex language that takes time to digest, but I still have to read them one by one.*

***What about reading papers for carrying out research?***  

*There are several stages when you are doing research. First, you need to find an interesting topic. In this stage, you must be very careful as it’s always easier for a paper in a new field to be accepted. Therefore, you need to find papers that are related with your topic, so you can find references and avoid topic overlap. There is a lot of searching required as well as plenty of reading. For each paper, there are many references that I need to check manually to have a better understanding of this paper.*

***Is an online platform that saves your time when reading a paper something you would like?***

*Of course, that would significantly reduce the time spent in this stage.*

***What kind of features are important for the platform?***  

*Maybe generating a summary for each section of the paper? Building a dependency tree of the references or detecting similar papers would be extremely helpful as well. It would also be useful if you can automatically extract metadata of each “interesting" paper, and maybe put them into a database (e.g., a .bib file for LaTeX).*

We further researched the market to find some existing solutions as well as to test whether the problems we listed are common and worth solving, so we constructed a survey and distributed it to our cohort.

Unfortunately, because of time constraints we did not receive as many responses as we expected. Nevertheless, we still got useful feedback regarding the features the potential users would like to see in the product. Here are some key insights:
- almost 50% of participants use some kind of software as a research assistance tool (other than referencing software)
- whole paper summarization and partial (segment) summarization are some of the most desirable features
- there are other ideas including generating figure descriptions, extracting references to a database and search tool

### Persona

Having analysed the survey and interview results, we created personas to better understand our potential users, their pains, needs, motivations and behaviours.
