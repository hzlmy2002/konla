We created a MOSCOW diagram to gather requirements that our users would expect from our system. MOSCOW stands for Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, and Would-have. The list of tasks separated into these sections allow us to prioritise certain features over others. We can plan to implement the most important requirements first from the Must-have section and then move to those in the subsequent areas. It also allows us to see the future potential of the project by discussing features that we may not implement in time, but would complete the system in the Would-have section.
