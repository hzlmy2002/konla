After the initial sketches, we started designing some mockups for the application. The mockups would show how the features from the hand drawings would appear to a user using the application. We created a mockup for each section of the application using [draw.io](https://draw.io/). We also copied all the mockup designs into a mockup design platform, [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), where we could add transitions for all the buttons, allowing us to simulate how a user might interact with the application. The interactive version can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/4Vaj580SXIfbNgF7qDAYxQ/Research-App-Mockup?node-id=19%3A35&scaling=contain&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=19%3A35).

![Upload section](/images/upload_section.png "Upload section")

The Upload Section is where the user uploads a paper. The mockup shows a drag-and-drop area as that might be one method of uploading a file. Other methods include: manual file selection and retrieving a paper from a URL.

![About section](/images/about_section.png "About section")

The About Section highlights the metadata from the paper. Author names are displayed comma-separated which can be sorted alphabetically or in how they appear in the paper. Metrics is data calculated on the text from the paper.

![Read section](/images/read_section.png "Read section")

The Read Section is where the user can read the contents of the paper. Headings and paragraphs are extracted from the file and shown in a custom style. The abstract is put into its own section.

![Figures section](/images/figures_section.png "Figures section")

The Figures section is where images from the paper are shown. The user can cycle through the figures in the order they appear in the paper. A title and summary are provided for each image.

![References section](/images/references_Section.png "References section")

References are extracted from the paper and displayed in a list.
