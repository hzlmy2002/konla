Our project is to make a platform that can help researchers to read papers.

We created a survey that can be used to collect inputs from researchers, but it seems there are some legal issues when we tried to let our tutor spread the survey. As our tutor suggested, we can arrange meetings with them to interview them and to learn what the researchers require from the application. Minyi got one input from his supervisor, Dr Maria. She suggested we can make a tool that can build the dependency tree of the references or detect similar papers (semantic similarly). Furthermore, we can extract metadata from some interesting papers into a database that can be exported.

We have created our first virtual persona: Dr Robert Jarvis, who is a medical researcher. We are ready to create the second persona which will be based on the inputs collected from the survey. Hopefully, we can have more progress by next week.
