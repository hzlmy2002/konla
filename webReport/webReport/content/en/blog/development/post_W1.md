### What happened this week?
* [18 Oct, Meeting with Client](#18-oct-meeting-with-client-onlinect-meeting)
* [19 Oct, Group Meeting](#19-oct-group-meeting-in-person)

### 18 Oct, Meeting with client [online]
##### Summary
* decided on weekly update meetings with the client to be held on Mondays 10am
* consider two user groups for the system: 
    1) Web administrators monitoring the resources of the webpage
    2) Researchers organising their resources and references
* as far as computing resources, weâ€™ll look to use the university ones in the first instance
* our client proposed [spaCy]((https://spacy.io/)) as a good Python NLP library to be considered when starting to work on implementation
* team members are familiar with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/), but can also learn [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

##### Tasks for this week
* [x] Start identifying the appropriate personas and use case descriptions
* [x] Interview the relevant potential user group (inc. pseudousers)
* [x] Should make a website for the project to host a blog, Lacibus can provide this or Minyi may be able to do so (correction: university provides hosting)
* [x] Find appropriate Python libraries to support UI once specified, team proposed Flask and Django (discussion to be continued once HCI work is done)

##### Next meeting
* Personas to be described (which?)
* Discuss design ideas and requirement suggestions
* Get the project blog website running and share it

### 19 Oct, Group Meeting (in-person)

##### Summary
* Signed documents about partnership with Lacibus Ltd.
* Discussed and considered both group cases, decided on focusing on Researchers group (a researcher wants to organise their materials)
* Brainstormed ideas about potential features and goals, usability of the project product
* Short research on competition, found great source of scientific articles and papers: [science.org](https://www.science.org/)
* Created a Google Drive Folder for keeping and sharing our resources

##### TODO
* [x] Research competition, what is and what is not available?
* [x] Research Personas
* [x] Find and talk to potential users
* [x] Think about pseudo-users (way to gather information on what is needed?)
* [x] get the project blog configured and running (decide on host: uni)

##### Ideas that came up this meeting
* Shorten the time of reading the document / publication (by summarization, knowledge graphs, bookmarking)
* Include a section that organises images with labels, tables and graphs (as tiles?)
* Make use of metadata
* Organise references
