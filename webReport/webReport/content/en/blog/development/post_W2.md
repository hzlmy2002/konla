  This week is focused on gathering information about potential users and collating findings of our research.
  We are working towards finishing the HCI stage of the project.

### Tasks:
* [x] Personas (1 & 2)
* [x] Wireframe Design
* [x] Technology Review

### 24 Oct, Group Meeting
* collated finding on target users and [existing solutions / competitors](#existing-solutions--competitors)
* drafted [a survey](#survey) for further research using MS Forms (alternatively can be transformed to Google Forms)
* Survey will be finished, discussed with client on 25 Oct, and published the same day

### 25 Oct, Client Meeting
* discussed survey - everything looks good
* survey published and distributed to pseudousers
* shared progress on HCI section slides

### 28 Oct, new feedback collection
Minyi got useful feedback from his Personal Tutor. The findings were added to Google Drive Interview Insights.

### 31 Oct, Group Meeting
* Development blog is running
* Quick training on adding posts
* Added new tasks to Asana
* Discussed available prototyping tools, chose [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for wireframe design

### Existing solutions / competitors
There are numerous software solutions to aid researchers in their work. Most researchers use referencing software. Other software solutions have features like:
* [typeset.io](https://typeset.io/), templates for research paper and writing software
* [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview), templates and writing software
* [TLDRthis](https://tldrthis.com/), summarization tool for research papers, articles and newspapers (paramethrised, no technology details available)
* [ContentMine](https://contentmine.github.io/), tool for mining "knowledge" from research papers
* [IrisAI](https://iris.ai/), web-based research workspace, analysis tool, features include summary generation, extraction and systemization of data, filtering, trained and adapted to user research field
* and others...

Most (in not all) of these tools are available commercially or offer free account with highly limited features. IrisAI features seems to be in line with our initial requirements, yet there is no information available about the technology behind it.
