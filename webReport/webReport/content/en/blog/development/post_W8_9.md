### 6 Dec
* Bart shared his learning notes about spaCy, they are available at Google Colab notebooks in project Google Drive. They include a primitive approach to summarizing research content (used on an example text extracted from pdf with the use of poppler)
* Bart shared a Project Requirements document including project assumptions, aims, objectives, requirements, delivery proposal, deadlines and milestones

### 7 Dec
* Added more features to MoSCoW list, moved features between categories
* Suraj created a block diagram for the system, [see more](#block-diagram-v1)

### Block Diagram v1

We created block diagrams to allow us to design our system and how the many components would interact with each other.

![Block Diagram - Version 1](/2021/group6/images/block_diagram_v1.png "Block Diagram - Version 1")

The very first version focused on describing the flow of data starting from the user uploading a PDF to being passed into the various functionalities provided by the backend. Many of the components would be from the MOSCOW list and allowed us to plan what features to implement for the system.

![Block Diagram - Version 2](/2021/group6/images/block_diagram_v2.png "Block Diagram - Version 2")

After settling on the features of our system, we produced a new version of the block diagram which separated the components into the input/process/output areas. The output section allowed us to describe how the user would see the data coming from different components on the frontend.
