We began our design process with a few sketches of how the system would look. It allowed us to come up with core features that would be shown to the client to be discussed. By drawing the first sketches on paper, it enabled us to focus on generating key ideas instead of worrying about the exact layout of all elements.

Sketch 1 contains the sections: Upload, Sidebar, Figures, and About of the application.
The Sidebar is how the user will navigate the application once they have uploaded a paper. It provides buttons to go to different areas of the app.

We also drew two more sections: Read and References. The About Section is continued here, but in the actual application, the About section would be scrollable, allowing the user to access the rest of it.
